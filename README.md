I started by creating a class 'Employee' and a class 'Fulltime Employee' that inherited the properties of 'Employee'. I also created adata member that counted the number of 'Employee'. I then used constructors that initialized the name, family, salary, and department for the Employee class. I also created a function that calculated the average salary of all Employees. Lastly, I printed all the relevant information for each Employee along with the average salary of the employees.

I started by importing the libraries and used the request.get url to obtain data from the specific wiki page.Then, I opened a text file named 'wikilinks.txt' to append the information and print the title of the page. I also used elem.xpath to navigate through the elements and obtain the 'href' elements as strings. I then print all the links to the output text file named 'wikilinks.txt'.

I started by creating an vector of size 20 that has random floats that have a value less than 20 and then I used .reshape to reshape the array in order to create a 4 x 5 array. I then used while loop  .arrange to create a new array which has the maximum values replaced with zero. Lastly I print out all three arrays which were generated by the vector starting from the array with random numbers, the array that has been reshaped to create a 4 x 5 array, and the 4 x 5 array that has the maximum values replaced with zero.
